<h1>Dealer Dataset Notebook</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This notebook project focuses on creating and analyzing a dataset related to car dealerships. The dataset contains information about various dealers, including their names, locations, contact details, brands/manufacturers they represent, available inventory, services offered, ratings/reviews, special offers, and hours of operation.

<h3>Dataset Creation</h3>
The dataset was created by combining random information from a CSV file with the dealer's credentials and a vehicle dataset to associate each car with a dealer. The CSV file contains information such as dealer names, locations, contact details, and vehicle data. By merging this information, we constructed a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

<h3>Dataset Information</h3>
The dataset comprises a collection of records, with each record representing a car dealership. The dataset includes the following information for each dealer:

Dealer Name: The name of the car dealership.
Location: The physical address of the dealership, including the city, state, and ZIP code.
Contact Details: Phone numbers and email addresses for the dealership.
Brands/Manufacturers: The specific car brands or manufacturers that the dealership represents or sells.
Inventory: Information about the vehicles available at the dealership, including new and used cars, electric models, and their stock numbers.
Services: Details about the services offered by the dealership, such as sales, leasing, financing, trade-ins, maintenance, repairs, and parts.
Dealer Ratings/Reviews: Ratings and reviews provided by customers who have previously interacted with the dealership.
Special Offers: Any ongoing promotions, discounts, or incentives offered by the dealer.
Hours of Operation: The dealership's business hours, including opening and closing times for each day of the week.
Credentials: A list of credentials associated with the dealer, including usernames and passwords.
Vehicles: A list of vehicles associated with the dealer, including vehicle make, model, year, and stock number.
